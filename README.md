# Fortnite Scrim bot for discord
scrim/snipe bot for discord built with node.js and discord.js

# Installation
It's simple!!! :D
- Download Node.js and install it
- Clone this repo or download it
- Open cmd or terminal (depending on what you're using)
- Navigate to folder where you cloned or downloaded this bot through cmd or terminal (if you don't know how to do it, google it then)
- Type npm install (make sure in that folder is package.json file)
- Insert your bot token in bot.js file (at very top)
- ... and you're done! Next just type in same directory of cmd "node ." or "node bot/bot" and everything should be working.

# Progress
It's finished. I have there few useless things, such as requiring a muted role but you can ignore that. I wanted to implement for it more features but i changed my mind and gonna keep this bot only for fortnite scrims/snipes. You can do it by yourself though if you want. As it has already functionality built to implement as many commands as you want with permissions.
